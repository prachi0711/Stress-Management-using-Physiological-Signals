# Stress-Management-using-Physiological-Signals

Stress is a common issue that significantly impacts mental and physical health, often diminishing overall well-being and productivity. Effective stress management
is crucial, yet many individuals struggle to recognize or address their stress levels in a timely manner. Advances in technology, particularly artificial intelligence
(AI), offer promising solutions by leveraging physiological signals to detect and mitigate stress in real time. This project explores an AI-based approach to stress
management by analyzing physiological indicators such as heart rate and skin conductance, enabling early intervention through personalized, interactive support.

Physiological signals—measurements of biological functions such as heart rate, skin conductance, and brain activity—provide direct insight into how the body responds to stressors. A key innovation of this system is its integration of physiological monitoring with conversational interaction facilitated by a companion robot. Unlike traditional methods that rely on self-reported assessments, physiological signals provide continuous, objective, and involuntary measurements of stress responses, making them more reliable and difficult to manipulate. These signals reflect the body’s dynamic reactions to stressors, allowing for tailored stress-relief strategies based on individual needs.
