# Stress-Management-using-Physiological-Signals

Stress is a common issue that significantly impacts mental and physical health, often diminishing overall well-being and productivity. Effective stress management
is crucial, yet many individuals struggle to recognize or address their stress levels in a timely manner. Advances in technology, particularly artificial intelligence
(AI), offer promising solutions by leveraging physiological signals to detect and mitigate stress in real time. This project explores an AI-based approach to stress
management by analyzing physiological indicators such as heart rate and skin conductance, enabling early intervention through personalized, interactive support.
